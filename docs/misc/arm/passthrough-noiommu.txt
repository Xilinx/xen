Request Device Assignment without IOMMU support
===============================================

*WARNING:
Users should be aware that it is not always secure to assign a device without
IOMMU protection.
When the device is not protected by the IOMMU, the administrator should make
sure that:
 1. The device is assigned to a trusted guest.
 2. Users have additional security mechanism on the platform.

This document assumes that the IOMMU is absent from the system or it is
disabled (status = "disabled" in device tree).

Add xen,force-assign-without-iommu; to the device tree snippet:

ethernet: ethernet@ff0e0000 {
	compatible = "cdns,zynqmp-gem";
	xen,path = "/amba/ethernet@ff0e0000";
	xen,reg = <0x0 0xff0e0000 0x1000 0x0 0xff0e0000>;
	xen,force-assign-without-iommu;
};

Request 1:1 memory mapping for the domain on static allocation
==============================================================

Add a direct-map property under the appropriate /chosen/domU node which
is also statically allocated with physical memory ranges through
xen,static-mem property as its guest RAM.

Below is an example on how to specify the 1:1 memory mapping for the domain
on static allocation in the device-tree:

/ {
	chosen {
		domU1 {
			compatible = "xen,domain";
			#address-cells = <0x2>;
			#size-cells = <0x2>;
			cpus = <2>;
			memory = <0x0 0x80000>;
			#xen,static-mem-address-cells = <0x1>;
			#xen,static-mem-size-cells = <0x1>;
			xen,static-mem = <0x30000000 0x20000000>;
			direct-map;
			...
		};
	};
};

Besides reserving a 512MB region starting at the host physical address
0x30000000 to DomU1, it also requests 1:1 memory mapping.
