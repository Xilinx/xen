Dom0 kernel and ramdisk modules
================================

Xen is passed the dom0 kernel and initrd via a reference in the /chosen
node of the device tree.

Each node contains the following properties:

- compatible

	Must always include at least the generic compatiblity string:

		"multiboot,module"

	Optionally a more specific compatible string may be used in
	addition to the above. One of:

	- "multiboot,kernel"	-- the dom0 kernel
	- "multiboot,ramdisk"	-- the dom0 ramdisk
	- "xen,xsm-policy"	-- XSM policy blob

	It is normally recommended to include a more specific
	compatible string (if one applies) in addition to the generic
	string (which must always be present).

	Xen will assume that the first module which lacks a more
	specific compatible string is a "multiboot,kernel".

	Xen will examine each module, starting from the second
	module that lacks a specific compatible string.  Xen will
	check each such module for the XSM Magic number:

	- For a module which has the XSM Magic number: it will be
	  treated by Xen as if its compatible string was
	  "xen,xsm-policy";

	- For a module which does not have the XSM Magic: the second
	  module lacking a compatible string will be treated by Xen as
	  if its compatible string was "multiboot,ramdisk"; for the
	  third and subsequent modules which lack a specific
	  compatible string, Xen will not apply any special treatment.

	This means if the ramdisk module is present and does not have the
	compatible string "multiboot,ramdisk", then it must always be the
	second module.

	Note: This XSM Magic detection behavior was introduced by Xen 4.7.
	Xen 4.6 (and downwards) still requires the XSM module to have the
	compatible string "xen,xsm-policy".

	Xen 4.4 supported a different set of legacy compatible strings
	which remain supported such that systems supporting both 4.4
	and later can use a single DTB.

	- "xen,multiboot-module" equivalent to "multiboot,module"
	- "xen,linux-zimage"     equivalent to "multiboot,kernel"
	- "xen,linux-initrd"     equivalent to "multiboot,ramdisk"

	For compatibility with Xen 4.4 the more specific "xen,linux-*"
	names are non-optional and must be included.

- reg

	Specifies the physical address of the module in RAM and the
	length of the module.

- bootargs (optional)

	Command line associated with this module. See below for the
	priority of this field vs. other mechanisms of specifying the
	bootargs for the kernel.

Examples
========

A boot module of unspecified type:

	module@0xc0000000 {
		compatible = "multiboot,module";
		reg = <0xc0000000 0x1234>;
		bootargs = "...";
	};

A boot module containing a ramdisk:

	module@0xd0000000 {
		compatible = "multiboot,ramdisk", "multiboot,module";
		reg = <0xd0000000 0x5678>;
	};

The previous examples are compatible with Xen 4.5+ only.

To be compatible with Xen 4.4 as well use the legacy names:

	module@0xd0000000 {
		compatible = "xen,linux-initrd", "xen,multiboot-module";
		reg = <0xd0000000 0x5678>;
	};

Command lines
=============

Xen also checks for properties directly under /chosen to find suitable command
lines for Xen and Dom0. The logic is the following:

 - If xen,xen-bootargs is present, it will be used for Xen.
 - If xen,dom0-bootargs is present, it will be used for Dom0.
 - If xen,xen-bootargs is _not_ present, but xen,dom0-bootargs is,
   bootargs will be used for Xen.
 - If a kernel boot module is present and has a bootargs property then
   the top-level bootargs will used for Xen.
 - If no Xen specific properties are present, bootargs is for Dom0.
 - If xen,xen-bootargs is present, but xen,dom0-bootargs is missing,
   bootargs will be used for Dom0.

Most of these cases is to make booting with Xen-unaware bootloaders easier.
For those you would hardcode the Xen commandline in the DTB under
/chosen/xen,xen-bootargs and would let the bootloader set the Dom0 command
line by writing bootargs (as for native Linux).
A Xen-aware bootloader would set xen,xen-bootargs for Xen, xen,dom0-bootargs
for Dom0 and bootargs for native Linux.


Creating Multiple Domains directly from Xen
===========================================

It is possible to have Xen create other domains, in addition to dom0,
out of the information provided via device tree. A kernel and initrd
(optional) need to be specified for each guest.

For each domain to be created there needs to be one node under /chosen
with the following properties:

- compatible

    For domUs: "xen,domain"

- memory

	A 64-bit integer specifying the amount of kilobytes of RAM to
    allocate to the guest.

- cpus

    An integer specifying the number of vcpus to allocate to the guest.

- vpl011

    An empty property to enable/disable a virtual pl011 for the guest to use.

- #address-cells and #size-cells

    Both #address-cells and #size-cells need to be specified because
    both sub-nodes (described shortly) have reg properties.

Under the "xen,domain" compatible node, one or more sub-nodes are present
for the DomU kernel and ramdisk.

The kernel sub-node has the following properties:

- compatible

    "multiboot,kernel"

- reg

    Specifies the physical address of the kernel in RAM and its
    length.

- bootargs (optional)

    Command line parameters for the guest kernel.

The ramdisk sub-node has the following properties:

- compatible

    "multiboot,ramdisk"

- reg

    Specifies the physical address of the ramdisk in RAM and its
    length.


Example
=======

    domU1 {
        compatible = "xen,domain";
        #address-cells = <0x2>;
        #size-cells = <0x1>;
        memory = <0 131072>;
        cpus = <2>;
        vpl011;

        module@0x4a000000 {
            compatible = "multiboot,kernel";
            reg = <0x0 0x4a000000 0xffffff>;
            bootargs = "console=ttyAMA0 init=/bin/sh";
        };

        module@0x4b000000 {
            compatible = "multiboot,ramdisk";
            reg = <0x0 0x4b000000 0xffffff>;
        };
    };

    domU2 {
        compatible = "xen,domain";
        #address-cells = <0x2>;
        #size-cells = <0x1>;
        memory = <0 65536>;
        cpus = <1>;

        module@0x4c000000 {
            compatible = "multiboot,kernel";
            reg = <0x0 0x4c000000 0xffffff>;
            bootargs = "console=ttyAMA0 init=/bin/sh";
        };

        module@0x4d000000 {
            compatible = "multiboot,ramdisk";
            reg = <0x0 0x4d000000 0xffffff>;
        };
