	---help---
	  When a PCI device is assigned to an untrusted domain, it is possible
	  for that domain to program the device to DMA to an arbitrary address.
	  The IOMMU is used to protect the host from malicious DMA by making
	  sure that the device addresses can only target memory assigned to the
	  guest.  However, when the guest domain is torn down, assigning the
	  device back to the hardware domain would allow any in-flight DMA to
	  potentially target critical host data.  To avoid this, quarantining
	  should be enabled.  Quarantining can be done in two ways: In its basic
	  form, all in-flight DMA will simply be forced to encounter IOMMU
	  faults.  Since there are systems where doing so can cause host lockup,
	  an alternative form is available where writes to memory will be made
	  fault, but reads will be directed to a scratch page.  The implication
	  here is that such reads will go unnoticed, i.e. an admin may not
	  become aware of the underlying problem.
