	This is an alternative implementation of the ARM GIC interrupt

	design and fixes many shortcomings of the existing GIC emulation in
	Xen. It will eventually replace the existing/old VGIC.
	However at the moment it lacks support for Dom0 using the ITS for
	using MSIs.

config HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR

	  Speculation attacks against some high-performance processors rely on

	  executing aliasing branches in the attacker context.  Such attacks
	  can be partially mitigated against by clearing internal branch
	  predictor state and limiting the prediction logic in some situations.

	  This config option will take CPU-specific actions to harden the
	  branch predictor against aliasing attacks and may rely on specific
	  instruction sequences or control bits being set by the system
	  firmware.

	bool "Cortex-A53: 827319: Data cache clean instructions might cause overlapping transactions to the interconnect"
	default y
	depends on ARM_64
	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 827319 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 with an AMBA 5 CHI
	  master interface and an L2 cache.

	  Under certain conditions this erratum can cause a clean line eviction
	  to occur at the same time as another transaction to the same address
	  on the AMBA 5 CHI interface, which can cause data corruption if the
	  interconnect reorders the two transactions.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to
	  data cache clean-and-invalidate.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 824069 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p2 when it is connected
	  to a coherent interconnect.

	  If a Cortex-A53 processor is executing a store or prefetch for
	  write instruction at the same time as a processor in another
	  cluster is executing a cache maintenance operation to the same
	  address, then this erratum might cause a clean cache line to be
	  incorrectly marked as dirty.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to
	  data cache clean-and-invalidate.
	  Please note that this option does not necessarily enable the
	  workaround, as it depends on the alternative framework, which will

	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 819472 on Cortex-A53 parts up to r0p1 with an L2 cache
	  present when it is connected to a coherent interconnect.

	  If the processor is executing a load and store exclusive sequence at
	  the same time as a processor in another cluster is executing a cache
	  maintenance operation to the same address, then this erratum might
	  cause data corruption.

	  The workaround promotes data cache clean instructions to

	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 832075 on Cortex-A57 parts up to r1p2.

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might deadlock when exclusive load/store
	  instructions to Write-Back memory are mixed with Device loads.

	  The workaround is to promote device loads to use Load-Acquire
	  semantics.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.

	  If unsure, say Y.

	bool "Cortex-A57: 834220: Stage 2 translation fault might be incorrectly reported in presence of a Stage 1 fault"
	default y

	help
	  This option adds an alternative code sequence to work around ARM
	  erratum 834220 on Cortex-A57 parts up to r1p2.

	  Affected Cortex-A57 parts might report a Stage 2 translation
	  fault as the result of a Stage 1 fault for load crossing a
	  page boundary when there is a permission or device memory
	  alignment fault at Stage 1 and a translation fault at Stage 2.

	  The workaround is to verify that the Stage 1 translation
	  doesn't generate a fault before handling the Stage 2 fault.
	  Please note that this does not necessarily enable the workaround,
	  as it depends on the alternative framework, which will only patch
	  the kernel if an affected CPU is detected.
